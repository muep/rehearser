The resolution for addressing
[#26](https://github.com/muep/rehearser/issues/26) seems to
be that the database can be this somewhat abstract thing,
even if the initial product might focus on learning tunes.

The terminology should map so that [reharsal, exercise,
variant] respectively become [rehearsal, tune, instrument].

The rationale is that this seems easy enough to work with
and the mapping is clear enough. This will hopefully avoid
having to rename everything even if some spinoff arises.
