The source code of the at least initial whole is maintained in a
single Git repository.

Having things in a single repository is expected to make it more
convenient to do changes affecting the whole system. These will happen
especially in the start.

In some ways I would prefer separate repositories for front-end and
backend, but a single-person project will not have an organizational
divide between those anyway.

It is envisioned that infrastructure stuff will still require a small
separate repository.
