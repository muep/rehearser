# ADR-X Insert title here

## Context

Describe enough of the context for the decision below to make sense

## Decision

Describe what was decided

## Expected Consequences

This section should consist of a few paragraphs that descrive the
expected consequences in a neutral way. (note how there is a separate
section for evaluating the situation)

For format, prefer doing a paragraph per consequence rather than
lists. There are often consequences that can be either positive or
negative, depending on the reader's viewpoint.

Also if needed, explain here how the decision needs to be taken into
account in the future.
